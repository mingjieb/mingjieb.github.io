<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am a research scientist at the Multi-agent Lab, Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence ([BIGAI](https://www.bigai.ai/)), China. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2023 from the [Robotics Department](https://robotics.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, where I was advised by Professors [Kira Barton](https://robotics.umich.edu/people/faculty/kira-barton/) and [Dawn M. Tilbury](https://robotics.umich.edu/people/faculty/dawn-tilbury/).

My research centers on distributed artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on multi-agent systems. I am interested in the following topics:

- **Research Areas:** Agent modeling, multi-agent interaction and decision-making, agent-based simulation
- **Methodologies:** Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), large language model (LLM)-based agents, optimization techniques
- **Applications:** Social simulation, smart manufacturing and supply chains, industrial robotics
